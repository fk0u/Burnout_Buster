## 🔋 Energy Battery ("Baterai Sosial")
Think of this as your mental fuel gauge. It starts at **100%** and changes throughout the day based on your activities.

- **Draining**: 
  - Happens automatically as time passes (simulating daily wear and tear).
  - High screen time or negative moods accelerate the drain.
- **Recharging**:
  - Log a **Positive Mood** to boost your battery (+10%).
  - Take a break in **Zen Mode**.

**Tip**: Try to keep your battery in the Green zone (>50%) by taking small breaks!

Located on your Dashboard, this advanced tool predicts your burnout risk using AI.

- **How it works**: It analyzes your recent chat sentiment (are you stressed or happy?) and app usage patterns.
- **Risk Levels**:
  - 🟢 **Low Risk**: Smooth sailing. Keep vibing!
  - 🟠 **Medium Risk**: Slow down. Consider a digital detox.
  - 🔴 **High/Critical Risk**: Immediate break recommended.

## 🧘 Zen Mode ("Fokus Dulu")
Stop doomscrolling and start focusing with a gamified twist.

1. **Select Duration**: Choose how long you want to focus (e.g., 20 mins).
2. **Start Session**: A digital egg appears.
3. **The Challenge**: If you leave the app (to check Instagram, TikTok, etc.), the incubation fails.

## 💬 Offline AI Chat ("Jedo Lite")
Talk to **Jedo**, your AI friend, even without an internet connection.

- **Privacy First**: All offline chats are processed locally on your device. No data leaves your phone.

## 🎭 Mood Tracker
Log how you feel daily to track trends over time.

- **How to log**: Tap the "Mood" tab and select an emoji that represents your current state.
- **Impact**: Logging mood helps calibrate your **Burnout Radar** and recharges your **Energy Battery**.

## 🔒 Security & Permissions
- **PIN Protection**: Secure your journal entries with a custom 4-digit PIN.
